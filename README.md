# animal-gear
This is fork of Animal Gear, the original version found here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1541438907 and Owlchemist's fork which served as a starting point here: https://github.com/Owlchemist/animal-gear

I have completely redone the rendering code to use modern Rimworld methods, trying to keep the difference between "Pawn Apparel" and "Animal Apparel" as minimal as possible.
